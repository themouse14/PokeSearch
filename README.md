# PokeSearch

As developers, we wanted to create a website for gamers to find their favorite games by genre or year, as well as a storefront to purchase the chosen game.

## Description and Usage

When the user opens the webpage, they will see a drop down menu for the genre and a drop down menu for the year.

When the user finds a game they like through the given parameters, the application will also populate price and a storefront where the user can purcahse that game.

The user interface will be easy and simple to use, with a drop down menu for each search option.
