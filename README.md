# PokeSearch

As developers, we wanted to create a website for Pokemon card collectors and enthusiasts to look up their favorite pokemon from the original Kanto region.

## Description and Usage

When the user opens the webpage, they will see a list from the original 151 Pokemon, with an image of their respective Pokemon card image.

When the user finds a Pokemon they like, they will see the Pokemon type listed alongside their card image.
